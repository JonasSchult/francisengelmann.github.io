# Guides
This is a collection of short guides to setup or use various software:
## Git
A visual introduction explaining the three different areas and the commit graph.

Git differs between three different states. A file is always in exactly one of these states:
- Working area: Currently editing the file. Changes on these files have to be added to the staging area first before commiting.
- Staging area: All files in this area will be part of the next commit. Imagin this stage as a temporary state for files to accumulate until the next commit.
- Commite area: All files in here were already commited and being tracked by the repository.

## PyCharm
### Code-Completion
* Select correct virtualenv: ```File/Settings.../Project[...]/Proj.Interpreter/```
* Also in settings: ```Editor/General/Code Completion```
